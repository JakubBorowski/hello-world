# hello-world
My first repository

Hi!

My name is Kuba and I'm from Poland. By the end of August 2016 I discovered a little thing called programming. It interested me immensely and soon became one of my biggest passions. By the time I'm writing this I've mostly been learning c++ language and just a tiny bit of JavaScript. I hope to have a good time here and learn a lot more. :)
